# What Needs to be Done

* Improve Security Tracker & Integrate it with the Source Tree
* Security Fixes
* Update Packages for Cucumber Linux 2.0
* Release Cucumber Linux 2.0
* Come up with a new distribution lifecycle to make the developers' lives
  easier.

# How to do This

1. Create a maintenance team.
  * This team will be broken down into subteams for each supported version of
    Cucumber Linux.
  * Each subteam will be responsible for building new packages for its version
    of Cucumber Linux.
  * Idealy, each subteam will have two leaders:
    1. A senior branch maintainer.
    2. A junior branch maintainer.
  * The senior and junior branch maintainers will have the same rights,
    capabilities and privileges; the difference in titles is really just a
    formailty. The senior title will go to whichever developer has been part of
    the Cucumber Linux project longer.
  * The senior maintainer, junior maintainer and Scott will be the only ones
    with access to that version's build infrastrucutre.
  * The senior maintainer and junior maintainer will be responsible for
    building and publishing updated packages for their version of Cucumber
    Linux.
  * The senior and junior branch maintainers will be the ones who merge changes
    into their version's source tree.
  * The maintenance team's primary goal should be keeping the distribution
    stable.

2. Create a security team.
  * This team will be responsible for the following one time actions:
    * Making a better security tracker.
    * Exporting the database from the old tracker to the new one.
  * The security team will then be responsible for the following actions:
    * Ensure entries for vulnerabilities are made in the security tracker.
    * Analyze new vulnerabilities against all supported versions of Cucumber
      Linux and determine what actions need to be taken.
    * Notify the individual Cucumber Linux branch maintainers of what actions
      need to be taken to patch the vulnerability on each supported version of
      Cucumber Linux.
  * The security team's primary goal should be keeping the distribution secure.

3. Create a development team.
  * This team will responsible for developing the unstable version of Cucumber
    Linux.
  * This team's primary goals should be designing new versions of the
    distribution and keeping the packages in the unstable version up to date.

4. Create a few supporting positions/teams:
  * Recruitment - Responsible for recruiting new developers, maintainers and
    security analysts.
  * Public Relations - Responsible for promoting Cucumber Linux and building a
    positive community around the project.
  * Webmaster - Responsible for maintaining the website and web server.
  * Postmaster - Responsible for maintianing the mailing lists and mail server.
